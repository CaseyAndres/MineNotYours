Fleshing out the prioritization methodology:
DONATION:
add sleeper as current's recipient.
if sleeper has a recipient
   donate to sleeper's recipient(recursive call)
add current to sleeper's donators list in the first slot.

swap priorities.
reschedule.
UNDONATION:
while lock's holder has something in its donator's list, swap priorities with the thread in the first slot, and then remove
it
release the lock.
